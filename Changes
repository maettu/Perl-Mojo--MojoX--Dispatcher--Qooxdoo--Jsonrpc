	*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***

        - the service module has to explicitly tell which
          of its methods are to be called remotely via the
          rpc_access_allow.

        - drop the whole _ prefix thing ... and call the
          check_access, mojo_session and mojo_stash by their actual names

        - enhance pod to cover new things    
        
        - follow new mojo class style in examples
