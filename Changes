Revision history for Perl extension MojoX-Dispatcher-Qooxdoo-Jsonrpc:

0.86    use warn instead of warnings -> fix for rt#75866

0.85    up required Mojolicious version to 2.49 and adapt route invocation
        accordingly

0.84    make compatible with Mojolicious::Static API changes

0.83    removed excess loggin left in from development

0.82    make the code more mojoy
        rewritten QX_SRC_MODE to be more versatile in serving 'the source'

0.81    If the service has a 'controller' property, it will get the current
        controller context assigned. This supersedes the 'mojo_*'
        properties, they are now deprecated.

0.80	*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***
        The QooxdooJsonrpc plugin does not install a /source
        path automatically anymore ... there were too many problem
        with other parts of the application which would need special
        attention to work with relative requests coming from a different
        'path' ... starting with this version, there are now two
        environment variables that govern source mode:

        QX_SRC_MODE=1 will enable serving your application from
        ../frontend/source ... 

        QX_SRC_PATH=/where/ever/source allows to specify some other 
        directory to serve your application from.

0.76    - require mojo 0.34 to make sure we don't run into
          trouble with old versions.

        - ship index.html without redirecting to it ... 
          this makes for nicer urls

          setting up routes

          the qooxdoo source code and contrib downloads

0.72    Sat Mar 26 2011
        - send requests and results to log at debug level

	*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***

        - the service module has to explicitly tell which
          of its methods are to be called remotely via the

          check_access, mojo_session and mojo_stash by their actual names
